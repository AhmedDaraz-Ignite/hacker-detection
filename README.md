# hacker-detection

## prerequisites
  1- install maven to build the code
  2- run mvn clean package
  3- from generated jar file, you can run "--logfile="java App C:\temp\in\New Text Document.txt"
  
##, I use plugin Lomobok, it is a compile time annotation processor plugin, in order to avoid compilation errors in IDE (eclipse, intiliJ)
install the plugins on the related IDE.

## However you don't need to install the plugin in order to build the project, just install and run maven.
