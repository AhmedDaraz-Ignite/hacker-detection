## prerequisites
  * install maven to build the code
  * run mvn clean package
  * from generated jar file, you can run "java App --logfile=C:\temp\in\file.log"
  
I use plugin Lomobok, it is a compile time annotation processor plugin, in order to avoid compilation errors in IDE (eclipse, intiliJ)
install the plugins on the related IDE.

However you don't need to install the plugin in order to build the project, just install and run maven.
